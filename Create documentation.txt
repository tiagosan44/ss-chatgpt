Test Classes Description
PlayerAnalyzerTest
PlayerAnalyzerTest contains a series of test cases aimed to verify the correct functioning of the PlayerAnalyzer class. It simulates various player scenarios: from junior, normal, to senior players. Additionally, it tests edge cases such as when skills are set to null or when provided with an empty player array. Through these tests, we ensure the reliability and robustness of the PlayerAnalyzer class, especially its ability to calculate scores based on a player's age, experience, and skills.

StudentConverterTest
StudentConverterTest ensures that the StudentConverter class works accurately in converting and evaluating student data. This class tests various student scenarios like high achievers, students who've just passed, or those who've failed. Furthermore, it checks edge cases such as when the input list is empty or set to null. The primary focus of these tests is to ensure that the conversion mechanism works correctly, identifying whether a student is an honor roll, exceptional, or if they've passed or failed based on their grades.

Running Tests Locally
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Your project should be using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
Steps:
Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal or command prompt.
If you're using Maven, run the command:
bash
Copy code
mvn test
If you're using Gradle, run the command:
bash
Copy code
./gradlew test
This will compile and execute all the tests in the project.
Upon completion, you should see an output indicating the number of tests passed and failed.
For a more detailed report, you can check the target directory (for Maven) or the build directory (for Gradle).
Remember, these instructions are generic. You might have specific configurations or steps based on your project setup. Always refer to your project's documentation for specific instructions.
